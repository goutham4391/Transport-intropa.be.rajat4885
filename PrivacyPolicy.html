    <h4>II. What data do we collect about you, for what purpose and on what ground we process it</h4>
    <p>
        We do not collect any Personal Data about you. Personal data means any information capable of identifying an individual. It does not include anonymized data.<br><br>

        Where we are required to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of the contract between us and you do not provide us with that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract (for example, to deliver goods or services to you). If you don’t provide us with the requested data, we may have to cancel a product or service you have ordered but if we do, we will notify you at the time.<br><br>
        We will only use your personal data for a purpose it was collected for or a reasonably compatible purpose if necessary. For more information on this please email us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#d8bfbca8aa98b1b6acaab7a8b9f6babd"><b><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="89cecdd9dbc9c0e7fdfbe6f9e8a7ebec">[email&#160;protected]</span></b></a>. In case we need to use your details for an unrelated new purpose we will let you know and explain the legal grounds for processing.<br><br>

    <br>
    <h4>III. Marketing communications</h4>
    <p>
        We <b>currently</b> do not use this website for marketing communications. Our lawful ground of processing your personal data to send you marketing communications is either your consent or our legitimate interests (namely to grow our business).<br><br>
        Under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, we may send you marketing communications from us if
        <ol>
            <li>you made a purchase or asked for information from us about our goods or services or</li>
            <li>you agreed to receive marketing communications and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving such communications since.</li>
        </ol>
        Under these regulations, if you are a limited company, we may send you marketing emails without your consent. However, you can still opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time.<br><br>
        Before we share your personal data with any third party for their own marketing purposes we will get your express consent.<br><br>
        If we will use this website for marketing communications, you can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by emailing us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#3d5a594d4f7d5453494f524d5c135f58"><b><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d99e9d898b9990b7adabb6a9b8f7bbbc">[email&#160;protected]</span></b></a> at any time.<br><br>
        If you opt out of receiving marketing communications this opt-out does not apply to personal data provided as a result of other transactions, such as purchases, warranty registrations etc.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>IV. Disclosures of your personal data</h4>
    <p>
        We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below:
        <ul>
            <li>Other companies in our group who provide services to us.</li>
            <li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
            <li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers.</li>
            <li>Government bodies that require us to report processing activities.</li>
        </ul>
        We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>V. International transfers</h4>
    <p>
        We share your personal data within our group of companies which involves transferring your data outside the European Economic Area <b>(EEA)</b>.<br><br>
        We are subject to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulations that protect your personal data. Where we transfer your data to third parties outside of the EEA, we will ensure that certain safeguards are in place to ensure a similar degree of security for your personal data. As such:
        <ul>
            <li>We may transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or</li>
            <li>If we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as they have equivalent safeguards in place; or</li>
            <li>Where we use certain service providers who are established outside of the EEA, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
        </ul>
        If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>VI. Data security</h4>
    <p>
        We have put in place security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, altered, disclosed, or accessed without authorization. We also allow access to your personal data only to those employees and partners who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they must keep it confidential.<br><br>
        We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach if we are legally required to.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>VII. Data retention</h4>
    <p>
        If you contact us through this website, we will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.<br><br>
        When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.<br><br>
        For tax purposes the law requires us to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they stop being customers.<br><br>
        In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>VIII. Your legal rights</h4>
    <p>
        Under data protection laws you have rights in relation to your personal data that include the right to request access, correction, erasure, restriction, transfer, to object to processing, to portability of data and (where the lawful ground of processing is consent) to withdraw consent.<br><br>
        You can see more about these rights at: <a href="https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/" target="_blank">www.dataprotectionauthority.be</a><br>
        If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#0a6d6e7a784a63647e78657a6b24686f"><b><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="98dfdcc8cad8d1f6eceaf7e8f9b6fafd">[email&#160;protected]</span></b></a> .<br>
        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.<br><br>
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.<br><br>
        We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you.<br><br>
        If you are not happy with any aspect of how we collect and use your data, you have the right to complain to the Data Protection Authority Office (DPA), for data protection issues (<a href="https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/" target="_blank">www.dataprotectionauthority.be</a>). We should be grateful if you would contact us first if you do have a complaint so that we can try to resolve it for you.
